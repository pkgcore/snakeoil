    Metaclass providing __del__ without the gc issues

    For python implementations previous to 3.4, there are serious issues in the
    usage of the __del__ method- this is detailed at
    http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ .

    Summarizing, reference cycles that involve an object that has a
    __del__ method cannot be automatically broken due to the free form
    nature of __del__.  This means __del__ is dodgy to use in practice.

    Weakrefs, by their nature of not strongly ref'ing the target (thus being
    impossible to participate in a reference cycle) are able to invoke finalizers
    upon the target's refcount becoming zero.

    Essentially, what this metaclass does is make it possible to write __del__
    without the issues of __del__; the sole thing you cannot do in __del__ in this
    usage is resurrect the instance.

    This metaclass modifies the target class, renaming it's __del__ to __finalizer__
    and modifying instance generation to return a proxy to the target instance.  This proxy
    is detailed in :mod:`snakeoil.obj`, but suffice it to say it's pretty much
    transparent to all consumers.  When the proxy object is collected, a weakref callback
    fires triggering the proxy targets __finalizer__ method.

    The end result of this trickery is that you can use __del__ w/out the gc issues
    when using this metaclass, and without the specialized hacks required of other
    finalizer implementations.  With this metaclass, you write __del__ as you normally
    would, and have full access to self (rather than a subset of attributes as other
    implementations induce).

    Note that while this makes __del__ possible, it still is recommended to use
    contextmanagers where possible, and alternative approaches that favor a
    deterministics/explicit finalization instead of the implicit finalization that
    __del__ implies.  There however are instances where __del__ is the most elegant
    solution available, thus this metaclass existing.

    Finally, note that the resultant finalization code (the raw `__del__` method)
    is invoked only once on the target instance- attempts to do otherwise via
    invoking __finalizer__() become no-ops.

    Example usage:

    >>> from snakeoil.weakrefs import WeakRefFinalizer
    >>> class foo(object):
    ...   __metaclass__ = WeakRefFinalizer
    ...   def __init__(self, attr):
    ...     self.attr = attr
    ...   def __del__(self):
    ...     print("finalization invoked: %s" % (self.attr,))
    >>>
    >>> obj = foo("bar")
    >>> print(obj.__class__.__name__)
    foo
    >>> print(obj.attr)
    bar
    >>> # note that the resultant instance no longer has a __del__
    >>> # method
    >>> print(hasattr(obj, '__del__'))
    False
    >>> # but it *does* have a __finalizer__ method.
    >>> print(hasattr(obj, '__finalizer__'))
    True
    >>> del obj
    finalization invoked: bar
