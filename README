WHAT IS SNAKEOIL?

  snakeoil is a python library that implements optimized versions of common
  python functionality. Some classes and functions have cpython equivalents,
  but they all have native python implementations too.


WHO TO CONTACT IF I FIND A BUG?

  Please submit a bug/ticket via https://github.com/pkgcore/snakeoil/issues .


TESTS?

  A standalone test runner is integrated in setup.py; to run, just execute
  setup.py test
  Aside from that, our runner of choice is twisteds trial; ran via-

  trial snakeoil

  if you're doing development, trial is significantly friendlier; the
  standalone runner is designed to be used mainly for installations of
  snakeoil, where all tests must pass, else installation is aborted.


INSTALLING:

  pretty simple-

    tar jxf snakeoil-0.XX.tar.bz2
    cd snakeoil-0.XX
    python setup.py build

  if after running tests,

    cd snakeoil-0.xx
    python setup.py test

  finally, installing-

    cd snakeoil-0.xx
    python setup.py install
