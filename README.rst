snakeoil
========

snakeoil is a python library that implements optimized versions of common
python functionality. Some classes and functions have cpython equivalents,
but they all have native python implementations too.

Installing
==========

Installing latest pypi release in a virtualenv::

    pip install snakeoil

Installing from git in a virtualenv::

    pip install https://github.com/pkgcore/snakeoil/archive/master.tar.gz

Installing from a tarball or git repo::

    python setup.py install install_headers

Tests
=====

A standalone test runner is integrated in setup.py; to run, just execute::

    python setup.py test

In addition, a tox config is provided so the testsuite can be run in a
virtualenv setup against all supported python versions. To run tests for all
environments just execute **tox** in the root directory of a repo or unpacked
tarball. Otherwise, for a specific python version execute something similar to
the following::

    tox -e py27

Note that mock_ is required for tests when using python-2.7.
