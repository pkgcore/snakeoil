Object trickery including delayed instantiation and proxying

Note that the delayed instantiation/proxying that is in use here goes several steps
beyond your average proxy implementation- this functionality will take every
step possible to make the proxy appear as if there was _no_ proxy at all.

Specifically this functionality is aware of cpython VM/interpretter semantics-
cpython doesn't use __getattribute__ to pull certain methods (`__str__` is an
example most people are aware of of, `__call__`, `__getitem__`, etc are ones most
aren't).  Delayed instantiation is significantly complicated when these methods
aren't properly handled- you wind up having to pay very close attention to exactly
where those instances are passed to, what access them, do they trigger any of the slotted
special methods, etc.  There is a catch to this however- you can't just define
all slotted methods since if the proxy has those slotted methods, it will use them
and you can't just throw TypeErrors- the execution path has differeed.

Part of the purpose of snakeoil is to make things that should just work, *work*- this
implementation exists to do just that via removing those concerns.  The proxying
knows what the resultant class will be and uses a custom proxy that will appear
the same to the python machinery for slotted methods- literally the python VM
won't try to __iadd__ the proxy unless the resultant class would've supported that
functionality, it will consider it callable if the resultant class would be, etc.

By and large, this proxying is transparent if dealing in python objects (newstyle or old)-
for example,

>>> from snakeoil.obj import DelayedInstantiation_kls
>>> class foo:
...   def __init__(self, value):
...     print("instance was created")
...     self.attribute = value
...   pass
>>> delayed = DelayedInstantiation_kls(foo, "bar")
>>> print(isinstance(DelayedInstantiation_kls(foo), foo))
True
>>> print(delayed.attribute)
instance was created
bar

This proxying however cannot cover up certain cpython internal issues- specifically
builtins.

>>> from snakeoil.obj import DelayedInstantiation
>>> delayed_tuple = DelayedInstantiation(tuple, lambda x: tuple(x), range(5))
>>> print(delayed_tuple + (5, 6, 7))
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
>>> print((5, 6, 7) + delayed_tuple)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not "CustomDelayedObject") to tuple
>>> # the reason this differs comes down to the cpython vm translating the previous
>>> # call into essentially the following-
>>> print((5, 6, 7).__add__(delayed_tuple))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not "CustomDelayedObject") to tuple

Simply put, while we can emulate/proxy at the python VM layer appearing like the target,
at the c level (which is where tuples are implemented) they expect a certain object
structure, and reach in access it directly in certain cases.  This cannot be safely
proxied (nor realistically can it be proxied in general without extremely horrible
thunking tricks), so it is not attempted.

Essentially, if DelayedInstantiation's/proxies are transparent when dealing in native
python objects- you will not see issues and you don't have to care where those objects
are used, passed to, etc.  If you're trying to proxy a builtin, it's possible, but you
do need to keep an eye on where that instance is passed to since it's not fully transparent.

As demonstrated above, if you're trying to proxy a builtin object, the consuming code
will have to order its operations appropriately- prefering the proxy's methods
over builtin methods (essentially have the proxy on the left for general ops).

If that doesn't make sense to the reader, it's probably best that the reader not
try to proxy builtin objects like tuples, lists, dicts, sets, etc.
